-#### Bash completion for Composer package and dependency manager
+#### Bash completion for Composer Drupal packages
+This repository was forked from https://github.com/iArren/composer-bash-completion, 
+I've just did a cheap replacement in the grep filtering, to restrict packages to drupal modules.
+
 
 ##### Requirements
 
 * composer
+* drupal
+* bash :p
 
 ##### Installation
 
-1. To install you need to copy or make a symlink to `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions`
+1. Get the bash completion script and move it to `/etc/bash_completion.d/composer`:
+
+    ```
+    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anairamzap/composer-bash-completion/master/composer && mv composer /etc/bash_completion.d/composer
+    ```
+
+    Note, that you would probably need root privileges to mv the file. If that's the case just add 'sudo' before mv command `sudo mv composer /etc/bash_completion.d/composer`
+2. Create a symlink to `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions`:
+
+    ```
+    ln -s /etc/bash_completion.d/composer /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/composer
+    ```
+
+    Once again, add root privileges with sudo if needed.
+
+
+3. Source your bahsrc to 'apply changes' or restart your console:
 
-2. Then just relogin or restart your console
+    ``` source ~/.bashrc
+    ```
 
 ##### Usage
 
 Before using completion you should install a composer as `composer` executable.
-After then all done you can use it like `apt-get`.
-Here is some features:
+After then all done you can use it like you use `apt-get` with auto-completion.
+Here are some features:
 
-* package name will be searched when using `require` command
+* package name will be searched when using `require` command. 
+So, for example you could type: `composer require drupal/men[TAB]` and bash should display all packages matching that pattern.
 
-* if previous was a package, so next will be a version completion of this package
+* packages names are restricted to drupal modules (this is done by a quick and dirty filtering by 'drupal/' using grep)
